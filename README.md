gulp blog scaffold
==================


First sketch for a static site with blogging driven only by gulp.

At this point it has no styling and only bare templates.  Its to show how gulp might be used as a static site generator.

What it does is compile and minify scss, javascript, static pages and blog posts.

It includes livereload support so you can write and design on the fly.

There are some extra as of yet unused packages included.

Season to taste.

Installaton:

		npm install
		bower install

Usage:

		gulp server

		gulp build
